# Section 2 Testing - (5 mins) #

# 3. BlackBox Testing:

* Black box testing is basically the manual testing of some feature without knowing the implementations
* Is basically testing a product with or without technical knowledge of and knowing internal working of product.
* We have some input to give and we suppose the expected output like we have a function which returns mean of n numbers so we call that function and it will return the mean of those numbers.
* Black box testing is a way of testing without knowing the internal working of the product. Just testing product bases on use cases and scenarios. No code or technical knowledge is required. 

# 4. Benefits of Test Cases:

* The main advantage of test cases is we make sure the behavior of the function is correct or not, Without going to the production we can test it while in the development phase.
* Another advantage of a test case is we write the code as expected by touching the corner cases and loopholes.
* When a product is large enough and regression testing is not possible every time. 
* To make the process more easy, error free and automate deployment with CI and CD.
